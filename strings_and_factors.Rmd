# strings & regex

## string vectors
```{r}
string_vec = c("my", "name", "is", "jeff")

str_detect(string_vec, "jeff")

str_replace(string_vec, "jeff", "Jeff")

```

## exact matches
```{r}
string_vec = c(
  "i think we all rule for participating",
  "i think i have been caught",
  "i think this will be quite fun actually",
  "it will be fun, i think"
  )

str_detect(string_vec, "^i think")

str_detect(string_vec, "i think$")
```

## you have a list of characters that will count as a match
```{r}
string_vec = c(
  "Y'all remember Pres. HW Bush?",
  "I saw a green bush",
  "BBQ and Bushwalking at Molonglo Gorge",
  "BUSH -- LIVE IN CONCERT!!"
  )

str_detect(string_vec,"[Bb]ush")
```


## range of characters that will count as a match
```{r}
string_vec = c(
  '7th inning stretch',
  '1st half soon to begin. Texas won the toss.',
  'she is 5 feet 4 inches tall',
  '3AM - cant sleep :('
  )

str_detect(string_vec, "^[0-9][a-zA-Z]")
```

## . matches anything
```{r}
string_vec = c(
  'Its 7:11 in the evening',
  'want to go to 7-11?',
  'my flight is AA711',
  'NetBios: scanning ip 203.167.114.66'
  )

str_detect(string_vec, "7.11")
```

## special characters: [ and ], ( and ), and .. If you want to search for these, you have to indicate theyâ€™re special using \. Unfortunately, \ is also special, so things get weird.
```{r}
string_vec = c(
  'The CI is [2, 5]',
  ':-]',
  ':-[',
  'I found the answer on pages [6-7]'
  )

str_detect(string_vec, "\\[")
str_detect(string_vec, "\\[[0-9]")
```


# thoughts on factors
```{r}
vec_sex = factor(c("male", "male", "female", "female"))
vec_sex
as.numeric(vec_sex)
vec_sex = fct_relevel(vec_sex, "male")
vec_sex
as.numeric(vec_sex)
```


# NSDUH

rescraping data from web
```{r}
nsduh_url = "http://samhda.s3-us-gov-west-1.amazonaws.com/s3fs-public/field-uploads/2k15StateFiles/NSDUHsaeShortTermCHG2015.htm"

table_marj = 
  read_html(nsduh_url) %>% 
  html_table() %>% 
  first() %>%
  slice(-1)
```

tidying these data
```{r}
data_marj = 
  table_marj %>%
  select(-contains("P Value")) %>%
  pivot_longer(
    -State,
    names_to = "age_year", 
    values_to = "percent") %>%
  separate(age_year, into = c("age", "year"), sep = "\\(") %>%
  mutate(
    year = str_replace(year, "\\)", ""),
    percent = str_replace(percent, "[a-b]$", ""),
    percent = as.numeric(percent)) %>%
  filter(!(State %in% c("Total U.S.", "Northeast", "Midwest", "South", "West", "District of Columbia")))
```

We used stringr and regular expressions a couple of times above:

in separate, we split age and year at the open parentheses using "\\("
we stripped out the close parenthesis in mutate
to remove character superscripts, we replaced any character using "[a-c]$"


visualize the data 
```{r}
data_marj %>%
  filter(age == "12-17") %>% 
  mutate(State = fct_reorder(State, percent)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = State, y = percent, color = year)) + 
    geom_point() + 
    theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1))
```


# restaurant inspections
```{r}
data("rest_inspec")

rest_inspec %>% 
  group_by(boro, grade) %>% 
  summarize(n = n()) %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = grade, values_from = n)
```


```{r}
rest_inspec =
  rest_inspec %>%
  filter(grade %in% c("A", "B", "C"), boro != "Missing") %>% 
  mutate(boro = str_to_title(boro))
```

filter to pizza places & group by borough
```{r}
rest_inspec %>% 
  filter(str_detect(dba, "Pizza")) %>% 
  group_by(boro, grade) %>% 
  summarize(n = n()) %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = grade, values_from = n)
```

filter to pizza places (non-case sensitive) & group by borough
```{r}
rest_inspec %>% 
  filter(str_detect(dba, "[Pp][Ii][Zz][Zz][Aa]")) %>% 
  group_by(boro, grade) %>% 
  summarize(n = n()) %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = grade, values_from = n)
```

visualization
```{r}
rest_inspec %>% 
  filter(str_detect(dba, "[Pp][Ii][Zz][Zz][Aa]")) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = boro, fill = grade)) + 
  geom_bar() 
```

visualization with reorder
```{r}
rest_inspec %>% 
  filter(str_detect(dba, "[Pp][Ii][Zz][Zz][Aa]")) %>%
  mutate(boro = fct_infreq(boro)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = boro, fill = grade)) + 
  geom_bar() 
```

if you want to rename a factor variable while keeping order:
```{r}
rest_inspec %>% 
  filter(str_detect(dba, regex("pizza", ignore_case = TRUE))) %>%
  mutate(
    boro = fct_infreq(boro),
    boro = fct_recode(boro, "The City" = "Manhattan")) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = boro, fill = grade)) + 
  geom_bar()
```
